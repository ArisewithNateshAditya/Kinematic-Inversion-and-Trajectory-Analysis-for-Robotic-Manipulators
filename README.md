Project Name: Kinematic Inversion and Trajectory Analysis for Robotic Manipulators

Description:
This project involves implementing second-order kinematic inversion algorithms for robotic manipulators using Matlab and Simulink. It addresses trajectory tracking with Jacobian inverse and pseudo-inverse methods, evaluates actual vs. desired outputs, and includes obstacle avoidance by adjusting operational space components.

File Structure:

Project_Report.pdf - Detailed report of the kinematic inversion and trajectory analysis.
Kinematic_Trajectory.m - Matlab script for computing kinematic trajectories and evaluating outputs.
Simulink_Model.slx - Simulink model used for simulation of the manipulatorâ€™s trajectory and kinematic inversion.
Plots/ - Folder containing plots of desired vs. actual trajectories, joint values, and error metrics.
Readme.md - This file, explaining the contents and structure of the project.
Installation and Usage:
Ensure Matlab and Simulink are installed on your system. Open Simulink_Model.slx in Simulink and run the simulation to visualize the results. Use Kinematic_Trajectory.m for additional trajectory calculations and analysis.
